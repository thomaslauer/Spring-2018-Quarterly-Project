# Introduction

The concept behind this project came from the realization of a common dilemma that we all faced living in residence halls—we shared laundry rooms with limited numbers of laundry machines. This meant that often times, people would have to walk to the laundry room initially without laundry to check if a laundry machine was available. If a laundry machine was available, then people would have to walk back to their rooms and make a second trip back to the laundry room this time actually with laundry, sometimes only to find that the laundry machines had been occupied again between the time they made the two trips to the laundry room.

Through this problem, we decided to create a device that would allow people living with shared laundry rooms to monitor the on-or-off status of laundry machines remotely, without having to make trips to the laundry room to find a conflict of interest in wait time to use the machines.

Our project aims to minimize the number of trips that people have to take to check the laundry room, the occurrences of forced laundry removal for people who don’t want to wait for others to take out their finished laundry, and overall, the efficiency of laundry machine use in shared laundry rooms. With our product that we’ve created through this project, we hope to increase the satisfaction of the residence hall living experience for students living on campus or people living with shared laundry machines for years to come.
